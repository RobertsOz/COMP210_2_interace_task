# Arm Tracking, Mask game

The game will be about having different abilities when wearing different masks. To really immerse the player in the change between masks. I will do full arm tracking by using two vive trackers in combination with the controlers to change body parts based on what mask you are wearing and if the arm tracking works the player will know where his apendages are at all times without looking down at his body. I will do full arm tracking for the left arm and have hand tracking combined with inverse kinematics for the right hand. To acomplish this I will attach one vive tracker to the left elbow and the other one to the belt to get the body rotation and the player will hold the controlers and use them as arms.

## Research
There is a project that does Full body tracking called IKinema that uses 3 vive trackers two attached to the feet and one to the waist to get tracking. But for my projects I need the precision to be on the upper body. 
As far as games, there are no games currently on the market where you gain abilities by picking up different objects, the market is mostly filled with games where you pick up the object and that objects has the properties it has like a gun, etc.
So even without arm tracking I feel like my game could stand out from all of the rest.

## Set backs
I started the project doing two trackers on both elbows and realised after doing it that there would be no way to know where my shoulders are without getting the rotation of the body.
